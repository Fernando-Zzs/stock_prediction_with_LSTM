## Predict stock with LSTM
### Characteristics

This project includes training and predicting processes with LSTM for stock data. The characteristics is as fellow: 

- Concise and modular
- Support two mainstream deep learning frameworks of pytorch and tensorflow
- Parameters, models and frameworks can be highly customized and modified
- Supports incremental training
- Support predicting multiple indicators at the same time
- Support predicting any number of days
- Support train visualization and log record
- Support obtaining the latest data from the network in real time

### Quick Start
1. click `Run 'main'` in main.py
2. open the `Terminal` and run in command: `streamlit run app.py`
